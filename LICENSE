Open Product License (OPL)

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated files (the "Software"), to use the Software 
for the sole purposes of review, commentary, learning and to make 
value-adding contributions to the Software via the main repository.

The creator ("creator") of the software is: 
Adrian McPhee & Farbod Saraf ("OpenUnited")

The main repository of the Software is located in the GitHub account of 
OpenUnited at: https://github.com/OpenUnited/

The source code of the Software is made available primarily to allow
collaboration via OpenUnited.com. To ensure efficient and effective
collaboration, and that the creator of the software has a viable business 
model, you may not create derivative works of the Software. 

You may also not sell the Software or trade commercially in the Software 
in any way. 

You may create a "fork" of the main repository and clone such a repository 
to your computer, for the purposes of making software contributions via 
"pull requests" to the main repository, where these contributions to the 
Software relate to tasks posted on openunited.com by the creator or an 
agent. This license must not be removed or altered in any forked 
repositories that you create.

You may not make the functionality of this Software, or a modified version, 
available to third parties as a service. Making the functionality of the 
Software or modified version available to third parties as a service includes, 
without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the functionality 
of the Software or modified version remotely through a computer network, 
offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the 
value of the Software or modified version, or offering a service that 
accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Software or modified 
version.

The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or
implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. In no event shall the
creator or contributors be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, 
whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or
in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the Software.

If you have obtained a commercial license for the Software from the creator or
an appointed agent, then the terms and conditions of the commercial license 
override this OPL. 

Without a commercial license, the software may operate in a mode with 
limitations applied - for example, limited user or other object counts, or
limited features. You are not permitted to remove such limitations. Doing so is
a violation of this license.

For the avoidance of doubt, whilst the source code of the Software is
available in a public repository and the collaboration model in which the
Software is maintained and improved is "open", the software does not satisfy 
the definition of "open source" according to the OSI. No claims are made that 
the Software is "open source" as defined by the OSI.

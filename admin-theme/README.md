## Using the template

This HTML template doesn't need a build step.
It means you can use it as HTML file with any server or any programming language.
Open the `/html/index.html` file in your browser and it works.
To use it on the server you can put the files from `/html` folder on your server and it works. you can also use it with any server-side language like PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. to add dynamic content.

## Build from source

If you want to modify the partials or styles, you can build the project from source. This step needs Node.js but you can build it once and then use the files from `/html` directory without Node.js or build steps.

### Using NPM

Once you are proven in product leadership, you can get equity invited. \nAlso, we should indeed learn and not over structure but we also need to think/recommend and be opinionated in terms of how we are going to manage/scale even just with the three products we have and it also is necessary to drive our valuation that we have a way of doing things, a scalable model etc"

<p class="text-lg mb-4">By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Our Services are diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Using our Services</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Do not misuse our Services. For example, do not interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, alter, or obscure any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Our Services display some content that is not OpenUnited's. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. Please be aware, however, that we do not necessarily review content, so please do not assume that we do.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    We may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information in connection with your use of our Services. You may opt out of some of those communications.
</p>

</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Your Content in our Services</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give OpenUnited (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services. Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Ensure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About Software in our Services</h2>

</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Modifying and Terminating our Services</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    We are continuously changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    You can stop using our Services at any time. OpenUnited may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care, and we hope that you will enjoy using them. There are, however, certain things that we do not promise about our Services.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER OpenUnited NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTION OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES "AS IS."
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Liability for our Services</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, OPENUNITED, AND OPENUNITED'S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF OPENUNITED, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    IN ALL CASES, OPENUNITED, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Business uses of our Services</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify OpenUnited and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit, or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, and legal fees.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About these Terms</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    These terms control the relationship between OpenUnited and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    If you do not comply with these terms, and we do not take action right away, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have - such as taking action in the future.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">
    The laws of The Netherlands will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of Utrecht, The Netherlands, and you and OpenUnited consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
